\frametitle{Model Training}
The sampled training data is passed to lightGBM, and the prediction is made with the testing data. \vspace{1em}

The hyperparameters are tuned with RandomizedSearchCV, with the scoring metric as recall. The function can be activated by assigning  \underline{tune\_parameters=True} while running the code.\vspace{1em}

\begin{lstlisting}
	# run model training
	model.main(df_business, tune_parameter=False)
